Follow Google C++ Style Guide:
- Clear naming, include order, header guards, avoid macros except constants.
- Prefer RAII, smart pointers, and explicit ownership.
- Avoid exceptions for normal control flow; return Status/StatusOr style if used in codebase.

Performance and safety:
- Avoid heap churn in hot loops (ranging/estimation paths).
- Bounds-check all buffers. Never trust network payload sizes.
- Do not use undefined behavior tricks; keep code portable to ARM64.

Interfacing:
- Keep serialization/deserialization code centralized.
- Always include units in variable names or comments (meters, seconds, ns).
