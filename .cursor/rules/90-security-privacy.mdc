Security baseline:
- No credentials or keys in repo. No hard-coded tokens.
- All endpoints/IPs/ports come from config/env.
- Don't open unauthenticated admin/debug endpoints on public interfaces.

Privacy:
- GNSS locations can be sensitive. If stored or transmitted, document:
  - what is stored
  - retention period
  - who can access it
- Avoid logging raw location unless necessary for debugging; prefer hashed session ids and summarized metrics.
